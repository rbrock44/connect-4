## ðŸ§  What's My Purpose?

This is a server side single-page react frontend created to play Connect 4 against another human or various AI difficulties [WIP]. I've enjoyed Connect 4 since high school, where a particular teacher (and football coach) was very good and I had to rise to the occasion as competition. I created this application in the Summer of 2025 when I was unemployed (laid off).

## ðŸš¦ How to Use

- `Select Color` - Yellow is selected by default
- `Select Player 2`
  - Human
  - AI - Easy -> 20% chance to block threat (win), 80% random (of available moves)
  - AI - Medium -> First look for winning move. Then 80% chance to block threat (win). Last is to find a strategic move and if that doesn't work the fallback is a random move
  - AI - Hard -> First look for winning move. Then block all threats (wins). Find safe moves (that don't give Player 1 a chance to win). Find harder strategic moves from that set and if all fail, fallback to a random move
  - AI - Iterative -> This version learns as you play. It will be harder and harder to win the more games playes

Other Actions
  - `Clear Board` - Can only be done after a game is started and is used to reset or restart a Connect 4 game
